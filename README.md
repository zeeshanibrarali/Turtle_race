# Turtle_race
We have heard about the horse racing now its time for the turtle racing hehe.
A fun way to learn Python or any other language is to create these types of games while your learning journey.
In this User will predict the color of the Turtle and then the race will start between six different colors of turtle.
I built this project using Trutle library of python.
